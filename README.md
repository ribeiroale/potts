# potts
Power Transmission Shaft Analysis Framework for Python
> A framework for the analysis of power transmission shafts in engineering

## Description
`potts` aims to be a general-purpose framework in Python for the analysis 
(and design) of power transmission shafts in the context of Mechanical 
Engineering. It is currently under development and has no releases.

Basic characteristics **intended** for `potts` include:

- **Beam loading analysis**: Solution of beam loading cases with: (i) point loads; 
(ii) uniformly distributed loads; (iii) linearly distributed loads; and (iv) 
point moments and torques. Plotting of shear, moment and torque diagrams.

- **Deflection**: Calculate the resulting deflection of a loading case for the 
general case of non-constant moment of inertia, I.

- **Stress analysis**: Given a set of critical (interest) points, establish the
general 3D stress state to allow for the application of (i) static and 
(ii) fatigue failure theories.

- **Shaft 3D model**: Allow to export the final design as a `*.step` file.

## Usage example

In construction.
